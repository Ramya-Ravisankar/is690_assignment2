15. **What is HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)? Provide an example of its implementation in your project's API responses, along with a screenshot.**

### Answer:
HATEOAS stands for Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State. It's a principle in the Representational State Transfer (REST) programming paradigm for web development that requires API responses to include hypermedia links to help clients navigate and interact with resources.

Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) is a constraint of the REST application architecture that distinguishes it from other network application architectures. With HATEOAS, a client interacts with a network application whose application servers provide information dynamically through hypermedia.

## An example of its implementation in our project's API responses, along with a screenshot:
Code snippet from the project:

[user_routes.py](/app/routers/user_routes.py)

```
async def get_user(
    user_id: UUID,
    request: Request,
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme),
    current_user: dict = Depends(require_role(["ADMIN", "MANAGER"]))):
    try:
        user = await UserService.get_by_id(db, user_id)
        return UserResponse.model_construct(
            id=user.id,
            nickname=user.nickname,
            first_name=user.first_name,
            last_name=user.last_name,
            bio=user.bio,

            links=create_user_links(user.id, request)  # Hypermedia links are created here
        )

```

```
def create_user_links(user_id: UUID, request: Request) -> List[Link]:
    """
    Generate navigation links for user actions.

    actions = [
